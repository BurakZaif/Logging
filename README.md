Logging Learning with Python

In this repository, I learned logging with Python. 

When I learn I divide the logging into 2 parts which are basic and advanced. You can see the files on the repo. 

In basic, I just learned to log in to one file with one configuration. 

In advanced, I learned to log multiple files with modules and add new loggers locally so do not to confuse the loggers.

If you want to reach other configuration types and features, you can look at this website: https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logrecord-attributes.


'''
Standard Logging Levels:

*Default logging level is Warning.

- DEBUG: Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.

- INFO: Confirmation that things are working as expected.

- WARNING: An indication that something unexpected happened, or indicative of some problem in the near future (e.g. ‘disk space low’). The software is still working as expected.

- ERROR: Due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function.

- CRITICAL: A serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.
