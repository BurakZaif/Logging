# Logging
Logging Learning with Python

In this repository, I learned logging with Python. 

When I learn I divide the logging into 2 parts which are basic and advanced. You can see the files on the repo. 

In basic, I just learned to log in to one file with one configuration. 

In advanced, I learned to log multiple files with modules and add new loggers locally so do not to confuse the loggers.

If you want to reach other configuration types and features, you can look at this website: https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logrecord-attributes.
